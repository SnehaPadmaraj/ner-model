I have attached a list confirmed attendees for this event on Mon 6th
November 
so that you can make your own carpooling arrangements. We will be
e-mailing 
you the address of the venue later this week.

I have also included in the 
list the first 8 people on the waitlist. We are
doing our best to organise 
more VC's and another table so that we can
accomodate you as well. We should 
be able to confirm by Thursday 2nd
November whether or not this will be 
possible.

As you will note from the attachment, we have still not received 
bios from
many of you. The purpose of these bios is not only to help the VC's

familiarise themselves with all of you in advance of the dinner, but to
help 
us place you on tables with VC's in your particular area of interest.
The 
FINAL deadline to receive your bios will be TUESDAY 31st OCTOBER at
7pm. 
Please do try to e-mail me your bio by this time. If your bios are not

received by then, we will have to place you randomly.

Also, many of you have 
sent me your regular resumes instead of the bios
that we asked for. These do 
not serve the purpose of providing the VC's
with personalised and targeted 
information about you and why you are
interested in meeting with them at this 
event. If you have sent me such a
resume, we cannot guarantee that it will be 
presented in the same format to
the VC's.

Following are the VC's who have 
confirmed that they will be attending:

Melissa Daniels, Morgan Stanley 
Venture Partners
Jennifer Gil Roberts, Sevin Rosen Funds
John Oxaal, Sevin 
Rosen Funds
Alexander Gove, Walden VC
Kevin Hartz, iMinds Ventures
Russ 
Irwin, Covergence Partners
Andy Lazlo, VantagePoint
Matt Ocklo, VantagePoint

Peter Loukianoff, Technology Funding Venture Partners
Roy Martinez, Intel 
Capital
Susan Mason, Onset Ventures
Joe McDonough, Barrington
Jay Morrison, 
Newbury Ventures
Adele Oliva, Particof & Co.
George Phipps, Patricof & Co.

EPMI's request to participate in the 29 Oct 01 FERC conference was granted.  I will be on one of two panels and I will be given 5 minutes to give a statement.

Please review the attached draft statement / talking points for EPMI and PGE and get me comments by COB Monday.  One question is whether we need to change what PGE is proposing to say in light of our position (rule certainty, make any changes to caps consistently accross the WSCC).

I will be meeting with the West Desk folks on Tuesday morning (schedules permitting).  Please let me know if you want to participate in that meeting.

Here is who I think will be on these panels thusfar:
California Rep. Anna Eshoo (D Atherton)
Pacificorp
Allegheny Supply (anybody know who might be speaking for them?)
Powerex/TGF Richard Tabors (note that Enron is a member of TGF but has made it clear it is not funding this effort)
PGE Mike Naeve
EMPI Alan Comnes
CAISO
Puget Energy - Kimberly Harris
and 5  other parties
BPA and WPTF will not be speaking.
I was told Commissioners ""may"" be present.

Subject: Seeking Intelligent Insight

It looks to me like the market for distributed computing will displace heavy 
iron within the next several years.  The structure is still very early in its 
development, but I think there will be commercial opportunities for Enron in 
bandwidth and electricity.  I would be interested to know what issues you two 
would see as the greatest hinderences and possibilities for these markets.  
If you would like, please feel free to comment on the attached documents.

Thanks,
Mark

this is going out to a broad group and may not be relevant to some, but 
please be aware that other ENA assets may go into the velocity/condor 
structure at a couple points this year. also we can all pray (i think it is 
ok to use this word in the current political climate and in a secular sense, 
as i think our interests are aligned on this) that the ENE stock price goes 
up and for more room in the raptor vehicle so we may see more raptor hedges.

1.. as most of you are aware, the majority of ENA's merchant assets are in 
our project velocity structure. just to make sure that we confuse everyone, 
we use condor/whitewing/velocity/trutta names interchangeably although 
occasionally there are some distinctions (which i won't bore you with the 
details about so you can disavow all knowledge if you have/need/want to). 
just so you get the right lingo, trutta is the name of the ENA subsidiary 
where these assets now have a home. ENA, under a servicing agreement, is the 
servicer of the assets. i am attaching for your information the servicing 
guidelines in the agreement. the major restriction is that ENA cannot  sell 
assets for less than the contributed value into the structure. any EARLY 
warning of a potential sale of any of these assets would be greatly 
appreciated so we can check whether any restrictions apply and be ready, as 
there are some logistics involved. an email to donna lowry, mary heinitz and 
myself would be wonderful. if you do not do this, you may get on donna's 
list. of course i can't speak for her as to the repercussions envisioned, but 
let me suffice it to say that i am glad i am not on her list. at least that i 
know of.  

2. a number of these assets also have raptor hedges in place in addition to 
being in the velocity structure. only the portion of the investment that was 
on ENA's balance sheet was hedged. if an asset is sold that has been 
""raptorized"", the swap will need to be promptly terminated/notional amounts 
adjusted etc. again, give us as much notice as you can.

3. we also need notice (AHEAD OF TIME) of any follow on investments in the 
same merchant assets, exchanges of our interest or further fundings because 
STUFF will have to be done. i will not bore you with the details, but this 
STUFF cannot be done in ONE MINUTE contrary to the popular opinion of some 
business types whose names i will not mention here. we also are obligated to 
provide quarterly reports of the investments which describe any modifications 
to the investments during that calendar quarter. the first report is due 
april 11, 2001 for the first quarter of this year. we will be asking for your 
input with respect to your investments at the end of march. 

4. lists of assets currently in velocity and in raptor are attached fyi.

Subject: Enron Online Japan - Tax Issues =20

I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their=
=20
final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese=
=20
trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20
summary of their advice:

A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions
1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=
=20
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that=
=20
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput=
ed=20
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta=
x.

2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes

Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=
re=20
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20
imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t=
he=20
subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such=
=20
excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and=
=20
delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20
financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices.

3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions

If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=
=20
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.

B. Physically Settled Transactions
1. Consumption Tax

Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an=
d=20
on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab=
le=20
to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit=
e,=20
including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20
paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20
provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20
Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base=
d=20
customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20
capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a=
nd=20
then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20

If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20
commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20
required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20
consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a=
n=20
arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20
resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption=
=20
tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer.

2. Excise Tax

Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20
commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum=
=20
products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon=
=20
the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20
coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20
petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t=
o=20
excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities=
=20
before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a=
nd=20
has responsibility for payment of excise taxes.

C. Tax Representations

The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20
Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in=
=20
force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20
entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20
representations may provide that:

(1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl=
y=20
and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and
(2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20
entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article=
=20
of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in=
=20
the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20


Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati=
on=20
or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t=
o you.

Best regards,
Susan

Ten Cents A Dance
Ruth Etting
Words by Lorenz Hart and Music by Richard Rodgers (1930)

-charted at #5 (1930)


Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown

Seven to midnight I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes

Sometimes I think I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, big boy, ten cents a dance!

Jeff,

Honestly and for your (Enron) eyes only - attached is the modified 
spreadsheet of what my group is seriously looking at purchasing.  Basically, 
we like their Change Management tools but not really interested in Patrol 
(monitoring).

We will have a more definitive answer by Thursday.  We DBA's (eCommerce, 
Corp, and London) are trying to make a joint decision, but the other two 
groups are dragging out their evaluations...

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

Kevin,

Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer. Clayton 
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on. Vasant will formulate 
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold  Clayton  to it. If he fails to deliver the request for 
transfer will be rejected. Anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody.

Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) 
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be 
aware of it, because I have
serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.

The letter looks fine.  I want to make sure that we don't record anything 
stating the ROW price.  If we need to put it in Exhibit B or something else 
which is not recorded, let's do so.  Thanks.

Paragraph 9 would be deleted for the Lonnie Claytor and Jennifer McIntosh
easements, only.  I changed the letter to reflect that.  Please also note that
I added a fifth item.

l=20
items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.? After you are migrated to=
=20
Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.?? If more=

than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEN=
D=20
E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.? Cleaning up your Notes email now=

Enron=01,s messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Ou=
tlook=20
2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email=20
functions.=20

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to=20
Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated wit=
h=20
current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
? Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

? Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30)=
=20
thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
? All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
? To Do Items
? Journal Items
? Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years i=
n=20
the future will be converted.
? Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You wil=
l=20
need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Jeff,

Please check with Belden or I if you are going to use these curves for 
anything other than internal analysis or high-level negotiating.

If you need help converting into quarterly numbers, let me know.

Remember that the total cost of wholesale power includes ancillary services 
which you can estimated to be 5% of these amounts.  I.e., 105% of the curve 
price is the average power cost including A/S

Dear E204-1, E204-2 Students,
Since Saturday seemed to be the best time for students to attend another
review/discussion
session, I will hold a review on Saturday, May 13, in the afternoon
(approx. 1:30 PM).  I will have
to arrange for a room and will be more definite about the time next
week.  Unfortunately, I have
a time conflict in the morning, otherwise I suspect that would be
preferable.  I think we can get
the session videotaped, however.

I am not aware of any such agreement with Bank One.  They are not one of our 
top banking relationships, but it is good to see them get some ancillary 
business.

Thanks,

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

Guys,
   We need to terminate this (unilaterally if possible, or if not, bilaterally) and move towards settlement now (it's better to move to settlement prior to a default which I believe will be on Monday).  Who is not being responsive? I'll track them down and get an answer if I have to. I think that we're too late for today, so let's do it in the morning.

Ed and I are getting tickets to Tuna Christmas and wanted to know if any of
you were interested in going with us.  Here is the scoop:

Date:	Thursday Dec. 13th 8pm

Where:  Galveston, The Opera House.   I know it won't be a fun drive home
but the show is not coming to Houston this year.

Ticket Price: $36 or less.  We are getting the 36 tickets as I want good
seats on the first level.  However, we may not all be able to sit together.

I thought it would be fun to leave Houston a little early on Thursday, say
by 430ish and drive to Galveston for dinner somewhere and then go to the
play.

Let me know if you are interested in going, I plan on getting our tickets by
tomorrow.

FYI; let me know if you have any thoughts about my approach below.  I met with Jeff Golden earlier today and he suggested that such a ""matrix"" was being prepared and should be ready for distribution early next week.  It amazes me that we don't have all of this in a nice, neat little package.  I will push hard to make sure this gets put together.

Good luck on the forms of documents.  I tried to implement this for two years, but I couldn't get anyone in the legal department to take it on, nor could I get buy-in from the satellite corporate development groups.  I sincerely hope you are successful, although it may fall into the category of too little, too late....

Take care,

Some of what follows may be old news or otherwise outdated, but as I try to get up the learning curve w/r/t our efforts regarding asset dispositions, I thought it may be helpful to summarize some items that I would think could be extremely helpful in the organization of our commercial and legal actions.  I recognize that there is no ""one template fits all""; nevertheless,  it would be extremely helpful if we already have or are otherwise organizing the following:

(1) Forms of CAs, LOUs/MOUs, PSA Agreements, and other relevant M&A docs;
(2) Matrix-type organization for every asset/business/investment that is ""for sale"" providing for the following:
   (a) Asset description and location;
   (b) Ownership of asset, including ownership schematics;
   (c) Book value of asset; estimated market value--and support for such; relevant financial information;
   (d) Likely purchasers;
   (e) Restrictions on transferability, including tax issues, consents, regulatory approvals, financings, etc.
   (f) Lead commercial contact;
   (g) In-house legal support, accounting support, tax support;
   (h) Outside counsel (U.S. and local, where appropriate);
   (i)  Outside advisors (investment bank, etc) and their counsel;
   (j) Status report and likely (realistic) timeframe; and
   (k) Other

If any of you can advise me whether we already have these items in place or, if not, your suggestions in this regard, I would very much appreciate it.

Highlights of This Issue

Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sell-side and rating
agency analysts in New York yesterday.  The Governor outlined his plan for
restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their
obligations.  Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting.

Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure

The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities'
problems within the context of their existing rate structures. He indicated
that the temporary 9% rate hike from January 2000 would be made permanent and
that a 10% rate reduction that went into effect in January 1998 would be
reversed in March 2002.

Status of Negotiations with PG&E

As we noted in a February 26(**th) comment, the Governor has reached an
agreement in principle with Southern California Edison (EIX: B3/CC) to address
that utility's past under-collections.  He hopes to also have an agreement 
with
PG&E within the next 30 days, suggesting that progress was made in particular
in the last 2-3 days.  However, the Governor acknowledged that reaching an
agreement with PG&E was more difficult due to its larger under-collected
balance and lower rates compared with SCE.

Some Generators Agree to Haircut

The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily
agreed to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for their past due
receivables. When pressed about which parties they've had constructive
discussions with, he identified Williams (WMB: Baa2/BBB-), Enron (ENE:
Baa1/BBB+) and Dynegy (DYN: Baa2/BBB+).  We note that most of the generators
and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against
possible losses.  Importantly, the Governor said that he hoped that the banks
and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut.

Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative

The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with 
the
utilities that the legislature can support.  Although he admitted that he
couldn't prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative, the governor said
that in the end, the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket
books.  Thus, if there is ultimately a ballot initiative, Governor Davis is
optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited
impact on electric rates.

Status of Defaulted Utility Debt

As we have commented in the past, it appears unlikely that the resulting
legislation will pass with the required 2/3majority to go into effect
immediately.  Accordingly, there will be a several month lag before the
utilities receive any cash.  In response to a question, it appears that the
state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted
commercial paper.  But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation 
will
provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing.
Essentially, it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find
the money from their banks.

Governor's Strategy to Keep the Lights On

The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California
was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years.  
In
the intervening time, demand caught up with supply.  In response, he has
proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the
construction of new power plants.  He set a goal of having 20,000 megawatts
(mws) of new supply on line by 2004.

In addition, the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in 
the
transmission infrastructure.  In particular, he cited the need to expand the
capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to
move power from south to north within the state. He suggested that part of the
rationale for the state taking over the utilities' transmission grids was to
ensure that the additional investment takes place.  He also suggested that the
state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them 
to
continue to operate them.

In the meantime, the focus is to move away from California's over-reliance on
the spot market.  In that vein, Calpine (CPN: Ba1/BB+) yesterday announced the
signing of two long-term contracts with the state's Department of Water
Resources (DWR).  One of those contracts was to sell up to 1,000 mws over a 
ten-
year term.  The other was to provide up to 495 mw of peaking capacity under a
20-year contract.  Earlier in February, CPN had reached agreement with the DWR
on a separate 10-year contract for an additional 1,000 mws.

Have you had a chance to talk with Dave B. on any of this?  It might be 
helpful for you to put a call in to Tom Martin today to give him your phone 
number and to let him know that you are working closely with Dave and that 
you are available for any questions.  Nothing may come up, but I think that 
Tom would feel better with this gesture.  Probably wouldn't hurt to log the 
same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.  That will give 
all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on 
this project.  Do you have contact information for Brenda?  If not, I would 
get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.  She is making the rounds with 
Patrick Conner and the corporate development team, doing site visits on two 
additional paper mills that we may purchase.

Subject: Project Triple Lutz

To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the 
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been 
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of ""what if's.""  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1, 
and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that 
I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the 
Triple Lutz data room.  

In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am 
available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.  If any issues come up 
that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @ 
713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.  Once again, DO NOT HESITATE 
TO CALL ME!!!  I do not want anything falling through the cracks!

I think we should dig up that slip that Matt Hersh gave to Max saying that
he might have been exposed to an STD and then get the photo of his cock in a
doughnut to complete the circle.  Has anyone fwded that mail to Coco?  I'm
sure she has a couple fond memories for the two of them to savor throughout
their marrige.

Nikki,

How do we dial that number from the US?  Is there a particular country code 
we have to use?

no, the opposite.  saying price drop hasnt brought us closer to equilibrium.  we absolutley cant continue this loss of demand, otherwise we end up at 3.2 and the industry doesnt want to /cant end up there.   thus you must pick up at least some demand.  price must keep dropping .   price dropped $1.5 and haven't gained any demand.  that's the scary thing.  how much does it have to drop before we do find it?

so you think we could pop on on the heels of increased demand because of low prices....assuming demand returned to normal how do you think there economic conditions will mitigate this.

        our internal estimates were in the 102-106 range, so no.  i think pira overestimating the gas gen burn for the week.  problem is there is no real good burn for at least two weeks going forward.  we've dropped $1.5 in a couple months and havent picked up an mmbtu of demand.  that's a big problem

Rusty,
The Pink card, Form MD-10-R-A, requires an effective date of change.  What
do you suggest as the date?
I assume the new Operator is ""Bridgeline Storage Company, L.L.C.  Is this
still correct?
The signature blank normally will have the person's name typed above it and
then the phone #.  Should I use Brian L. Redmond, President of LRCI, Inc.
with a phone # (713) 853-1839 or Robert Morgan?
I'll send a copy of the pink card via fax.
Harry

John,

Per our conversation yesterday this is an email to clarify the ERCOT counterparty names that are in EnPower...

ERCOT Imbalance - ERCOT-IMBA - this counterparty is for commodities (must select a delivery point and have a zero price)
EPMI-ERCOT-POOL - EPMI-ERCOT - this counterparty is for transmission only (zero price)


Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. - ERCOT - this counterparty is for interdesk annuities

Thanks,
Michael

Hi Tana,

To answer your questions 

1. The companys full name is NatSource LLC
2. I'm not sure but it should be exactly the same as what we sent to True 
Quote, Houston Street and Espeed.
3. The project is for posting EOL prices on NatSources Electronic Trading 
Platform.
4. The companys address is 
Nat Source LLC 
140 Broadway
30th Floor, New York
NY 10005
It should be sent to the attention of Jack Hogan (Tel 212-232-5335, 
fax-212-232-5354) Their General Counsel is Andrew O Connor (tel 
212-286-1234). Andy Zipper will sign the document before it is sent.
5. Its not a rush we're just starting to talk to them.

I hope this gives you all the information you need. Thanks a lot. 

Savita

Subject: Confidentiality Agreements

In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following 
information:

1.  The company's full legal name
2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form
3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of 
transaction is it for)
4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number
5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday 
morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to 
talk to them)

	I met yesterday with Guillermo Vogel, CEO of Tamsa.( 110 MW).
He was interested in receiving a proposal from Enron, based on an import of power scheme.
He offered me to give us a quick response, on whether they are seriously interested.
He will be out of the country for two weeks, and told me he will be ready to review our deal then.
The steps are as follows:
			1) Mr Gustavo Rosas (from their Veracruz site) will provide all the information we require.
		                He called me today, and is preparing the information. (Mr Rosas phone no. 2989-1100 x 4006)
			2) Marc should call Mr Rosas next Monday 9, confirm all the information that I requested,
	                           and schedule a visit to Veracruz next week, since Mr Rosas wants to meet us there.
			3) Prepare a proposal with 10 and 15 years prices, that we should deliver in two weeks time. 
So far, it looks promising.
	Regards,	jaime____

Tom,
Here are two more suggestions.  Mr. Berg represented CBS in a couple of
defamation claims but generally does plaintiff's work.  Mr. Franklin, I am
told, also has a very good reputation and recently obtained a five million
dollar verdict in a case.  Please let me know I can be of further
assistance.

Tom, 

Maybe I mis-interpreted again, but here are the graphs for site total (the 
boxplots are still by turbine). This is for May. I will wait to see if this 
is more like what you need before continuing with the earlier months.

Loose Your Donkey

...""Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a
donkey ttied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring
them to Me. If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the
Lord needs them....""
- (Matthew 21:2-3)


A donkey was an animal of commerce in Jesus' day. It was used to
carry great burdens of goods from place to place and he was known
as the ""beast of the burden."" This donkey no doubt was owned by a
village businessperson. But Jesus told His disciples to fetch the
donkey for ""He had need of it."" This donkey played an important
part in Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It was a day that
was the culmination of three years of ministry. Jesus chose to
use a vehicle of commerce to bring Him into His most important
public display.

We are entering a time in our own history in which God is saying
to businesspeople, ""Loose your donkey for My purposes. I have
need of it."" God is preparing His Church to be a vessel for
ushering in a great harvest of souls. He is preparing His remnant
of businesspeople, who are like a tribe within the Church, to be
a major force in this great harvest.

""He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest
branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood
of grapes. His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter
than milk"" (Gen. 49:11-12). Is your donkey tied to the living
Vine, the choicest branch of Jesus Himself? When we are tied to
the living Vine, designed for His use, we will be useful in God's
Kingdom. Jesus wants to free us from the bondage of business
slavery; He wants us to walk in freedom so that others may see
God's grace flowing through us and our place in the business
world. Is your donkey available for His use?

Today, ask Jesus to allow the Vine to flow through you in every
area of your life.

Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of 
whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel 
rather than providing fuel in kind.  If you want the attachments (examples of 
other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.  Comments?  
Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of?

Hi Stacey !

Thank You for the report and for visiting us !

I proposed today for Neil Austin/London and Thorstein Jenssen/Oslo that we 
should take an other
property consultant to carry the task beside Healey&Baker.

Our landlord at the new premises is Regus  (www.regus.com).
This arrangement is fine and easy to leave.
We are staying here for 1-2 years, then apartment type or Oslo/London.

Some minor notes to Your very good draft.
Ms Heidi Sieppi moved to Oslo today June 6th 2001 to work there for 6 months.

Yes, Regus Offices.

Small cameras is a very good idea !   (< 100 $ each in Finland)

To office profile I would like to add: Helsinki office's one task is to 
recruit from Finland for Enron.

On the business control side: On our expense claims are travelling and minor 
marketing expenses

Sincerely, Juhani

Juhani,
Please see the attached Preliminary Finland Doorstep Review.  What is the 
status with the old office?  Let me know if anything does not read 
correctly.  I left the office pamphlet at my house, is it Remus?

Hope all is well in Finland.  Thank you again for all your help and 
information.

Thanks,
Stacey

I see what you mean - the GTC's get attached to the confirms when they are 
sent out so the confirm desk needs to know which ones to attach if they are 
different.

That is correct,  but the possible GTC amendments will be part of the daily

Subject: Re: Confirms

There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated 
transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for 
telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk 
the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the 
other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated 
trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the 
internet trading language in the confirm they generate?

Subject: Calpine deal summary

Thomas,

Here is a Calpine deal summary. 

ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from EE&CC.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, Heat rate, dispatch, and location of the 
plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of ENA 
bid curve.

I think it will be helpful if Thomas call EE&CC to get VOM ASAP, so that we 
can talk to Structuring group. Please review and let me know if it makes 
sense, and then I will send you, Scott, Richard Park, and Tom Swank.

If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group tomorrow. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not 
sure what exactly this is for. Thank you.

For Matt, your email stated that you trade over the IPE & NYMEX.  What rules, 
besides the rules of those two exchanges, might apply to any on or off 
exchange trades you might enter into.  For instance, here in the U.S. energy 
commodity trades might be governed by the CFTC, where out equity options 
might be governed by the SEC.  Besides the exchanges your email reflected, 
what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might 
enter into?

The panamax market has fallen about $1,000 over the last two weeks on basis 
of time charter rates.  For next year, owners have turned on average quite 
bearish and several are calling us directly to offer us their vessels at 
discounted numbers.  Interestingly, cape vessel owners have been watching the 
falling panamax market with trepidation.  Currently, the spread between the 
two sectors is about $13,000.  Over the last three days, time charter rates 
for cape size vessel for 12 months starting in January 2001 have dropped by 
approximately $1200 and brokers attribute the rapid decline to the 
unsustainable spread between the two vessel types.

Of significant interest this week, Bocimar called us to price put options for 
them.  They told us that they wanted some protection for next year but could 
not buy puts or sell swaps in the market place for fear of creating a panic 
selling mode from owners.  We offered them some prices which they told us 
were too expensive but we are still in discussion.  Our problem is that we do 
not want to diminish our short position for next year so in offering put 
options to Bocimar, we also want to keep selling the underlying - and that 
might be challenging as the market is very illiquid and there are not too 
many bids for next year at good selling numbers.

We are currently continuing to build a short position on panamaxes and are 
offering rates to AK Steel from Brazil to US gulf for their iron ore 
contracts and also offering Sidmar ( the Belgian steel mill ) some rates from 
Brazil into Gent.  We might join forces with Coeclerici on several of these 
tenders to mitigate the risk and also to share market information.

last but not least, we are studying the idea of taking a cape new building 
delivery 2003/2004 on time charter for 8 years with ability to extend for 
three additional years and the ability to buy the vessel after year three in 
Japanese yen.  The time charter rate is very attractive when compared to the 
average time charter rate of this size vessel over the last 5 and 10 years.  
Will keep you posted.

Hi.

How's it going?

Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a 
little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.

The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her know 
if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.

I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.  I 
figure you guys have lots of ""guy only"" stuff coming up, but there aren't a 
lot of ""mom/son"" opportunities.  (be realistic)  Maybe we should take a 
Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.

Love,

ckm"

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  It is obvious that the organizations and product 
lines can lever each other and the synergies will provide powerful results in 
our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

Subject: Update on GridFlorida and TCCs

Steve ,

The following is a quick update on  two important  issues ;

GridFlorida ....As you know from my last update we have a very good ""Market 
Representation "" on the Advisory Committee and at the first meeting last week 
we formed a Market Design Working Group (MDWG) to work on developing an 
improved Market Design in Florida. I have been voted in as the Chairman of 
the committee and our first order of business will be to improve the 
Congestion Management proposals and to develop a Real Time Energy Spot Market 
with ""uncovered"" and ""unbalanced "" schedules  . We now have the right  people 
in place and the real battle now begins .
.

TCCs..............We did very well and continue to grow the  business .The 
results of the winter TCCs season are now tabulated and they are as follows ;



Rev Bids  Nov   Dec  Jan  Feb   Mar  Apr  Total Revenue Winter Period

  337K   483K  932K  311K  552K  695K  928K               $4,238,000
       

                                                            


                            YEAR 2001       Total Revenue 2001 as of 4/30    


       311K  552K  695K  928K   $2,486,000


We have expanded our portfolio for the upcoming summer period and expect to 
increase our revenues over that period .We are on track to exceed our goal of 
$10 million for calendar 2001.

Dan

Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL 
had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for 
HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream.  
The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates 
to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made 
pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a 
day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a 
reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream 
represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not 
indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL 
or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been 
allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility 
for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from 
the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written 
correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it 
did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That 
contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation 
evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have been 
sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy 
of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the 
Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's 
agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved 
through arbitration.

Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum 
of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum 
in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the 
event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to 
remit such amount together with interest to Upstream."

John,

Just wanted to make sure everything went o.k.  I neglected to remind you 
again when we talked today about obtaining the Certificate of Occupancy, so I 
hope that the Seller delivered it as she had promised.  If not let me know so 
that we can find an immediate solution.  The only other things I would 
caution you on at this point would be as follows:

1)  Make sure to put together your list of warranty repairs prior to 30 days 
from today's date and to deliver same to the Seller within such time period 
(per the warranty agreement).

2)  Make sure to follow up with the Seller about the fireplace.  She is 
supposed to finish that work within 60 days from today's date.

3)  Make sure to compare your title policy, when it comes in the mail, to the 
marked Title Commitment you received today.  There shouldn't be anything in 
the policy that is not in the Title Commitment.  When you get the policy, you 
can send a copy to me and I will be glad to confirm this for you.

4)  You should get the recorded deed in the mail from the title company or 
the county clerk.  If you do not receive it within 30 days, call the title 
company and ask that they find it or obtain a certified copy for you.

If there is anything you need, just let me know.

The attached covers why I will be in India all of last week. Last year  I 
promised Sanjay I would come to India and make sure all of the arrows were 
pointed in the same direction , that we had clear goals and objective s and 
that we had the right resources focused on the problems.

QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================
""Sometimes if I go to a   household and they're all  
Americans, I'll cover my   name, I don't want them to
